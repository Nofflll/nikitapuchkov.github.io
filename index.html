      <h2>🌱 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer working in the aerospace industry. My focus is on developing engineering tools, predictive systems,
        and AI prototypes to support complex technical workflows. I’m currently transitioning into a Machine Learning Engineer role and
        actively expanding my skills in applied ML, Python, and intelligent systems.

      <h2>🚀 Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Assistant for Aerospace Engineers</strong><br>
          Developed an internal ML-powered assistant for engineers. Instead of performing raw calculations, it predicted key aerodynamic and structural parameters based on input context and historical data.
          <br><em>Technologies:</em> Python, NumPy, SQLite, Scikit-learn, Flask
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal AI Assistant</strong><br>
          In development: a smart assistant to manage local tasks, daily routines, device control, and context-based dialogue.
          <br><em>Technologies:</em> Python, LLM APIs, Voice IO, SQLite, Linux
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🎯 Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I'm working toward becoming a full-time ML Engineer in Europe, with a strong preference for Finland. I'm especially inspired by the balance between technology and nature, and the respect for clean engineering and calm design found in Finnish culture.
      </p>
      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleFinland()">Why Finland?</button>
      <div id="finland-block" class="hidden">
        <p>
          Finland aligns deeply with my personal and professional values. I'm currently learning the Finnish language (A2 level) and exploring its tech ecosystem.
          I admire the country's approach to clean technology, privacy-respecting AI, and ethical engineering. My long-term goal is to contribute to
          a Finnish or international team building meaningful, reliable AI systems.
